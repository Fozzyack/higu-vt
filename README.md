## Summary 
A small portfolio page for a Vtuber. The site gives a little description about her, showcases a twitch streamm as well as presents links to other platformms. Ther site was made to be asthetically pleasing much like other vtuber websites.

## Structure
Similar to [portfolio website](https://github.com/Fozzyack/myResume)

## Optimisations
- Hero section could be formatted to take up device height and therefore, would look better on mobile devices.
- Would potentially be a good idea to only have the handwriting animation occur once upon viewing.
- Navbars being behind the HeroImage looks strange when scrolling. Maybe add a scroll animation or remove its fixed position
